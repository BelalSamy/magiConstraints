# MagiConstraints

MagiConstraints is a syntactic sugar to make autolayout easier to use ... the idea is to satisfy all 4 constraints ( x-axis, width, y-axis, height ) in one line function by covering different ways to satisfy each constraint using enums parameters ... and also to create dynamic views like ( scrollViews and StackViews ) in a very simple way using one line function like magic âœ¨
